> Good questions. Look for ways to make analogies for a variety of audiences.

- Younger Audiences (middle school)
  - Why does a larger speaker result in a louder sound?
- Older Audiences (high school)
  - What causes just a magnet and copper wire to emit sound?

> Decide on what speaker parts are going to be purchased vs "made from scratch". Don't get bogged down with particulars, as long as it helps you explain the physics

- Bought
  - Paper
  - Styrofoam Bowl
  - Neodymium magnet
  - Copper wire
  - Tape

> Think of "unconventional" places where the physics of speakers are applied. (perhaps somewhere other than sound applications?)

Places where the physics are applied speakers are common. Speakers use a combination of electromagnetism and sound waves Electromagnetism is uses to turn electricity into heat for uses such as induction cooking. Sound waves can be used not only for audio for humans to hear, but are used for sonar technology, which allows us to "see" underwater purely through blasting sound waves, and seeing how long they take to return, using that to see how far they traveled to see if there are any obstacles nearby.
