I started off my build by buying the neodymium magnet and my copper wire.

I wrapped the copper wire around a paper tube slightly larger than the neodymium magnet.

I then put the magnet inside the tube, and assembled the rest of the speaker.

Right now, it was not ready to be used. However, I did want to test if the electromagnet itself worked. It did! I connected both ends of the copper wire to a battery, and it shot up as the copper wire was now repelled by the magnet.

This fulfilled my hypothesis, being that the electromagnet would work, moving the copper wire up and down.
