## what should i do?

- physics engine (i _love_ coding, and it could be super fun.)
- making my own speakers (frontrunner at the moment. seems really fun)
  - some sort of vibration motor, combined with flaps of material to project noise
  - could also use an arduino or some other circuit to manually process the audio and produce vibrations
- electric generator
- something with solar power (maybe could be combined with speakers)
- use solar panels to power arduino
- could talk about light energy, to electrical energy, to the energy to move the flaps to produce sound

this post will be updated with more info as i flesh out ideas more.
